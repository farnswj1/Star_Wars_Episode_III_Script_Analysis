# Star Wars Episode III Script Analysis
On May 19, 2005, *Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith*, the third and final installation of the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy, was released. The movie told the story about a young, but powerful Jedi knight that succumbed to dark side out of fear of his wife dying. It also showed the extermination of the Jedi as well as the fall of the Galactic Republic, which would be replaced by the Galactic Empire, with a Sith lord at the helm. The movie helps transition the saga into the Original Trilogy.

In this project, we used the Bing and NRC sentiments to analyze the script. We kept only the dialogue and omitted everything that wasn't intended to be spoken. We found that the most popular word in the movie was `jedi`. Similarly, the most common positive and negative words were `master` and `dark` respectively. We also found that Anakin is relatively more positive than the other characters in the movie. Characters like Palpatine express more anger than the others, however this is expected due to the fact that he is a Sith lord. Jedi Master Ki-Adi-Mundi was considered to be consistently very negative in both analyses; he was considered to be the most negative according to the NRC sentiments. However, Palptine was the most negative according to the Bing sentiments.

NOTE: The analysis was done on the script of the movie, not the movie itself. The dialogue may be different in the movie than in the script.
